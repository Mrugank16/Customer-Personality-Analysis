# Customer-Personality-Analysis

In this project, I performed unsupervised clustering on customer records from a grocery firm's database. Customer segmentation involved dividing customers into groups based on similarities within each cluster. This approach aimed to optimize the value of each customer to the business by tailoring products to meet the distinct needs and behaviors of different customer segments. Additionally, it will help the business address the concerns of various types of customers more effectively.
